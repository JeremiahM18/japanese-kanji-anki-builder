## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Tagged release workflow with artifact checksums and release-policy validation.
- Checked-in branch protection and release process documentation treated as repository contracts.

### Changed

- Tightened word-deck kanji breakdown selection so compound cards keep learner-friendly per-kanji readings instead of leaking whole-compound readings onto single-kanji panels.
- Added curated breakdown overrides for high-visibility N5 benchmark compounds such as `映画`, `銀行`, `郵便局`, `青い空`, and `夜空`, and aligned the golden review matcher with the exported formatting.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-03-31

### Added

- Deterministic kanji and word deck build pipelines with managed media packaging.
